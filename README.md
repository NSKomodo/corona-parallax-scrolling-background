# Corona SDK Parallax Scrolling Background
A horizontal parallax scrolling background implementation for Corona SDK. It compensate background layer gaps using delta time based on frames per second.

Easily adaptable to support multiple backgrounds. Current implementation contains a example on how to display a random background every time the application launches.

Your contributions and improvements are most welcome.

#### Known Issues
At speeds higher than 8.0, the gaps start appearing again. Might be my delta time implementation. I'm looking into this, but any tip or contribution will help a lot.
