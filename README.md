# Corona SDK Parallax Scrolling Background
A horizontal parallax scrolling background implementation for Corona SDK. Supports multiple backgrounds and background randomization. It also compensate gaps between layers using delta time based on frame rate.
Any contributions are most welcome.

#### Know Issues
For speeds greater than 8.0, the gaps start to appear and they grow over time. It might be my delta time implementation and I'm currently looking into it. Any help is much appreciated.
